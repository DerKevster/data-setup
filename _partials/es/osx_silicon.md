## Apple Silicon Chips

If you bought your computer after late 2020, chances are it has a new Apple silicon chip instead of an Intel processor: let's find out.

Open a new terminal window from Applications > Utilities or search for it with [Spotlight](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204014):

![Open Terminal on macOS](images/macos_open_terminal.png)

Copy-paste the following command in the terminal and hit `Enter` to execute.

``` bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/setup/master/utils/macos_list_processor_type.sh)"
```

☝️ The result of the command should indicate whether your computer uses Apple Silicon.

🚨 Keep this in mind. You will need to remember later on in the setup whether your computer uses an Apple Silicon chip or is an Apple Intel version
